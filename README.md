<h1>How to use/Features</h1>
You will need Java in order to use this.(Minimum 8 I think)
Run the jarfile from the releases tab and it'll just go! 

If you have Java installed, but the jar doesn't run when you double click it, you can shift + right click in the directory the jar is in and click "Open PowerShell/CMD here" then type "java -jar "FFXIV Duty Roulette.jar" and it will run.  

This program can pick a random standard Dungeon, Trial, or Raid from one or all of the expansions. The options to include higher difficulty duties are disabled because I felt they weren't overly important and didn't want to code them just yet.
